# Minesweeper

#download player.py and mygame.py

#run mygame.py in CLI to play the game

#if you wish to view older versions of this game,view old versions

#V1 has has easier medium and hard levels,complexity of these levels were increased in newer versions

#In final version of game we are operating using random moves for unlocking of inital moves of game but since this approach leads to infinite loop, we use systematic spiral breadth first approach which does not have impact for end-user. This spiral approach has been solely used in V2 for complete testing and version control

#If at any point final version of game runs into infinite loop, you have found a rare test case in which case either use V2(will never run into infinite),or try to decrease random_breaker variable.
